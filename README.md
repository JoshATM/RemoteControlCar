Put together with an arduino nano esp 32 (although you could use an off branded one for a lot cheaper), L298N, some cheap yellow motors of aliexpress with wheels, a 9v battery (could be anywhere from 6 volts to 21 volts) and a piece of wood that was £4 cut in half. I also added 2 capacitors which in this case would probably work without but I like to include them in all my breadboard projects just incase.

This was a small project just because I have seen rc projects and they've always interested me and I would like to come back to this and make a better rc project but I only wanted to test the waters and learn something new for now.
